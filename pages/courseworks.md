#### Master of Urban Planning at UW (Urban Analytics Track)

Currently, *Urban Analytics* or similar data science directions are not formal specializations in the MUP program at UW but students can apply for the [individualized specialization](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/specializations/) and benefit from one of the best data science universities on the earth. If you prefer to do so, I highly recommend you review basic calculus, probability, linear algebra, and programming before the beginning of the first year. Here is the example curriculum for the urban analytics track. BTW, you can move some required courses to the second year to balance your workload. 

##### First Year: Autumn

- **CSE 583 Software Development for Data Scientists 4**

##### First Year: Winter

- URBDP 501 Comprehensive Planning and Implementation 4
- URBDP 506 Planning Studio Prep 3
