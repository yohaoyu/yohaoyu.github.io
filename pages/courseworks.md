#### Master of Urban Planning at UW (Urban Analytics Track)

Currently, *Urban Analytics* or similar data science directions are not formal specializations in the MUP program at UW but students can apply for the [individualized specialization](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/specializations/) and benefit from one of the best data science universities on the earth. If you prefer to do so, I highly recommend you review basic calculus, probability, linear algebra, and programming before the beginning of the first year. Here is the example curriculum for the urban analytics track. BTW, you can move some required courses to the second year for balancing your workload. 

##### First Year: Autumn

- URBDP 500 Survey of Urban Planning 4 (*Waive if you have some planning foundation before*)
- URBDP 520 Quantitative Methods in Urban Design and Planning 4 (*Waive if you have a good statistics foundation before*)
- URBDP 527 History, Ethics, Form, and Theory 4
- **CSE 583 Software Development for Data Scientists 4**

##### First Year: Winter

- URBDP 501 Comprehensive Planning and Implementation 4
- URBDP 506 Planning Studio Prep 3
- URBDP 528 History, Ethics, Form, and Theory 4
- URBDP 573 Digital Design Practicum 4 (*Waive if you have a design background before*)

##### First Year: Spring

- URBDP 507 Urban Planning Studio 5
