      Hi, I'm Haoyu, a master student of urban design and planning at the <a href="https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/">University of Washington, Seattle</a>. 
      I'm also a part of the <a href="https://uil.be.uw.edu/">Urban Infrastructure Lab</a> led by <a href="https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/jan-whittington/">Prof. Jan Whittington</a> at UW 
      and the oversea observer of <a href="http://www.urbanchina.com.cn/">Urban China Magazine</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always had a passion for all stuff related to the city, rail system, skylines, the up-and-down stories of cities. 
      Now my research interests include infrastructure, urban carbon governance, urban studies under new technologies, and other odd city explorations.
