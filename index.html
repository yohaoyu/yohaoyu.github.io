    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p> 
      I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/urbdpphd/">Urban Design & Planning Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program</a> 
      at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/jan-whittington/">Prof. Jan Whittington</a> and
      <a href="https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/qing-shen/">Prof. Qing Shen</a>. I'm also a part of the <a href="https://uil.be.uw.edu/">Urban Infrastructure Lab</a>
      at UW and the oversea city observer in <a href="http://www.urbanchina.com.cn/">Urban China Magazine</a>. 
      I always have had a passion for all space and phenomena in cities and now my research interests lie in infrastructure planning, 
      urban carbon governance, and the combination of urban studies and data science.

    <h2>Coursework</h2>
    <p>
      During my Ph.D. stage, I plan to complete several course clusters, including public policy and institutions, climate change, infrastructure finance, 
      data science and statistics, for getting a solid knowledge background at the beginning of two years. 
      The arrangement is a continuation of my previous master's degree at UW which focused on Urban Informatics and Technologies. 
      And please check my <a href="https://yohaoyu.github.io/pages/phd-curriculum">full coursework list here</a> to see what I've done and my future plans.
