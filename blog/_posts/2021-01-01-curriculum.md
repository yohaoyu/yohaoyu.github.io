Urban Informatics is an unofficial [specilization](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/specializations/) in UW now (11/05/2021). Anyone who is willing to choose this area needs to submit the *Individualized Specialization Application* to get permission. I chose this path and here is the my curriculum for reference.
