Shekou Port is an important port in southern China, at the same time is the first place in China that implemented reform and open policy, contract labor policy, and a market economy.  Now, She Kou is a famous walking-and-biking-friendly block with diverse cultures and values. Many foreigners are living here and Shekou Port could link Shenzhen to Hong Kong and its airport, Macao, Japan, Vietnam, and Zhuhai.

Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is the longest cross-sea bridge in the world, which is 55 km with 4 artificial islands and a 7-km-long undersea tunnel. The photo here is of the piers of the bridge. The shape of piers indicates the Chinese knot and good luck to every boat and vehicle.
